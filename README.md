# nndl-project

Exploration of image classification into superclasses and subclasses, with low resolution images and novel classes introduced at test time.  

See [CNN](CNN/) for a simple convolutional neural network implementation of superclass and subclass classification combined, superclass alone, and subclass alone.  

See [resnet_fine_tuning](resnet_fine_tuning/) for a fine-tuned ResNet-18 model, again with implementations for superclass and subclass classification combined, superclass alone, and subclass alone.
